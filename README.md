# Graph-Markov-Neural-Networks-Implementation
GMNN code is downloaded from the authors link (https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/GMNN) and implemented so as to plot the validation accuracy of the model across 20 iterations. 

Run train.py file and change the name of the dataset to the desired one.
